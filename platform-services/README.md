# Platform Services

Platform services provide APIs for managing the platform.  This component integrates common Linux services to provide network management, modem management, Bluetooth and network discovery.  All platform service components provide D-Bus APIs and are associated with the system D-Bus instance.  Platform service daemons are started during system initialisation.
