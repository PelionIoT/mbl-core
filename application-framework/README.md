# Application Framework

The application framework provides APIs for managing the set of containerised applications that run on a device.  APIs are concerned with:

 * Application package management
 * Application life-cycle management
 * Application resource management
 * Core application container configuration

The application framework provides the building block services needed for implementing different application management solutions. The core API operations identified by the application management use-cases will be implemented as a set of scripts.  These scripts can be invoked directly from other scripts or via an application framework daemon that presents D-Bus APIs for IPC access.
