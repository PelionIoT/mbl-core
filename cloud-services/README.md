# Cloud Services

The Cloud Services component is concerned with providing device applications with access to Mbed Cloud services and for providing the process environment for running the Mbed Cloud Client.  To achieve this, upper-edge C/C++ APIs provided by the Mbed Cloud Client are mapped to a set of D-Bus interfaces to form a D-Bus service.
